# ICS46---Maze-Generator-Solver
Using recursive-depth first, breadth-first, and Kruskalâ€™s algorithm, implemented a maze generator that is initially a blank grid that tunnels out a maze which can be solved using the implementation for the maze solver which can either use breadth-first or recursive-depth first.
